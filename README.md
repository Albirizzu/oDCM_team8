### 1.1 Motivation
*Motivation for data context*

The aim of this paper is to collect data regarding theatrical movies, to answer the following research question: *What is the impact of Covid-19 on the film industry?*
Therefore, a dataset containing data of movies before, during and after the pandemic will be created (2015 until 2020). 
This will be valuable to compare different kinds of variables relating to the film industry during this time period and to get some new insights on what kind of impact Covid-19 
had, e.g. were there changes in revenues?  
As other datasets only have data about one specific year, this dataset has been merged to one combined dataset containing data of multiple years. 

*Motivation for choice website/API*

The following three websites have been assessed containing relevant data, regarding the reseach question:
<ol>
<li>First website: https://www.boxofficemojo.com/</li>
<li>Second website: https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top</li>
<li>Third website: https://www.the-numbers.com/</li>
</ol>
<p> All three websites show available data about movies, which is the first step to make the websites comparable to each other.  
Furthermore, all kind of data can be retrieved per movie, for example revenue in a specific year, genres, runtime, distibutor etc. The websites distribute enough data to fit the 
research and moreover, the data can be specified in variables to make it usefull for this research. </p>

<p> Comparing the websites with each other, the website of https://www.boxofficemojo.com stands out in terms of data availability about the movies. 
First, the data on https://www.boxofficemojo.com provides a simple overview of the top 200 movies based on revenue for a specific year. 
This is in contrast with the website https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top, which only gives an overview of the title of the top 100 movies based on the number of written reviews, 
which does not fit the research really well.
The third website https://www.the-numbers.com, also gives an overview of movies ranked on revenue, actually not only the top 200 but every released movie in a specific year.
However, the problem with https://www.the-numbers.com is that the revenues are based on the Domestic Theatrical Market performance (North American movie territory) only, which 
makes the data useless for this research. 
While this research looks for the global impact of Covid-19 on the movie industry. </p>

<p> Therefore, data will be scraped from https://www.boxofficemojo.com. </p> 



## **Composition**

The instances that comprise the dataset represent the titles of the films and the corresponding revenues that the film made in the cinemas. Furthermore, the data will be provided in IMDB ratings, if the rating is available to the corresponding film. 

*Length:* an amount of three instances.

*Amount:* all the data that was available is scraped. So for each year, there are 200 films with corresponding revenues and ratings. 

*Missing information:* 

*Explicitness:* 

*Level of self-containment:* The provided data relies on an external source, namely the [Box Office Mojo website](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/). Because the website gets updated regurlarly, users should notice that the data will change over time. 

## **Collection process**

**How was the data associated with each instance acquired?**
The film names and the revenues are acquired directly via [Box Office Mojo Worldwide page](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/?ref_=bo_nb_hm_tab). The ratings are provided via [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/). Also the ratings were directly observable via webscraping. 

**What mechanisms were used to collect the data?**
For the collection we used Jupyter Notebook running on Python. 

**Who were involved in the data collection process?**
The data collection was done by four students from Tilburg University for the class [Online Data Collection & Management](https://odcm.hannesdatta.com/)
