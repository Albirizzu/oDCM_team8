### 1.1 Motivation
*Motivation for data context*

The aim of this paper is to collect data regarding movies, to answer the following reserach question: *What is the impact of Covid-19 on the movie industry?*
Therefore, a dataset containing data before, during and after the pandemic will be created (2015 until 2020). 
This will be valuable to compare the movie industry during this time period and to get some new insights on what kind of impact Covid-19 had. 
As other datasets only have data about one specific year, this dataset has been merged to one dataset containing data of multiple years.
